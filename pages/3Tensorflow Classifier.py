    text = """The objective is to build a model that can classify whether a patient has 
    heart disease or not based on various features. It's a binary classification task 
    because the model predicts one of two possible outcomes:
    \nPresence of heart disease (positive class)
    \nAbsence of heart disease (negative class)
    
    \nTensorFlow and Keras for Building the ANN
    TensorFlow provides a powerful platform for numerical computations, and Keras acts 
    as a high-level API on top of TensorFlow, simplifying the ANN development process. 
    \nData Preprocessing:
    \nLoad the heart disease dataset (commonly used ones include Cleveland Clinic 
    Foundation data from UCI Machine Learning Repository).
    Preprocess the data by handling missing values, converting categorical variables 
    (if any) to numerical representations using techniques like one-hot encoding, 
    and normalizing the features to a common scale.
    \nModel Building: Define the ANN architecture using Keras. This typically 
    involves: An input layer with a size matching the number of features in the data. 
    One or more hidden layers with a specific number of neurons (activation functions 
    are applied within these layers to introduce non-linearity).
    An output layer with a single neuron using a sigmoid activation function (squashes 
    the output between 0 and 1, suitable for binary classification).
    \nModel Compilation:
    Specify the loss function (e.g., binary cross-entropy for binary classification) 
    to measure the model's performance during training.
    Choose an optimizer (e.g., Adam) that updates the model's weights to minimize the 
    loss.
    \nModel Training: Split the data into training and testing sets. Train the model on 
    the training set, iteratively adjusting the weights to minimize the loss and improve 
    its ability to distinguish between patients with and without heart disease.
    \nModel Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance on the unseen testing set using 
    metrics loss and accuracy. """

        text = """ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit): This is the most common activation function used 
        in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for hidden layers. It outputs the input 
        directly if it's positive (f(x) = x for x >= 0) and sets negative inputs to zero 
        (f(x) = 0 for x < 0). ReLU is computationally efficient, avoids the vanishing 
        gradient problem, and often leads to good performance in CNNs.
        \nSigmoid: This activation function squashes the input values between 0 and 1 
        (f(x) = 1 / (1 + exp(-x))). It's typically used in the output layer of a CNN for 
        tasks like binary classification (predicting one of two classes). 
        However, sigmoid can suffer from vanishing gradients in deep networks.
        \nAdditional Activation Function Options for Hidden Layers:
        \nLeaky ReLU: A variant of ReLU that addresses the "dying ReLU" problem where some 
        neurons might never fire due to negative inputs always being zeroed out. 
        Leaky ReLU allows a small, non-zero gradient for negative inputs 
        (f(x) = max(α * x, x) for a small α > 0). This can help prevent neurons from 
        getting stuck and improve training.
        TanH (Hyperbolic Tangent): Similar to sigmoid, TanH squashes values 
        between -1 and 1 (f(x) = (exp(x) - exp(-x)) / (exp(x) + exp(-x))). 
        It can sometimes be more effective than sigmoid in certain tasks due to 
        its centered output range.
        \nChoosing the Right Activation Function:
        \nThe best activation function often depends on the specific problem and 
        network architecture. Here's a general guideline:
        \nHidden Layers: ReLU is a strong default choice due to its efficiency and 
        ability to avoid vanishing gradients. Leaky ReLU can be a good alternative, 
        especially in deeper networks. TanH is also an option, but ReLU is often preferred.
        \nOutput Layer:
        \nBinary Classification: Sigmoid is commonly used here for its ability to output 
        probabilities between 0 and 1.
        \nMulti-class Classification: In this case, you'd likely use a softmax activation 
        function in the output layer, which normalizes the outputs to probabilities that 
        sum to 1 (useful for predicting one of multiple exclusive classes).
        \nExperimentation:
        \nIt's always recommended to experiment with different activation functions to see 
        what works best for your specific CNN and dataset. You can try replacing "relu" 
        with "leaky_relu" or "tanh" in the hidden layers and "sigmoid" with "softmax" 
        in the output layer to see if it improves performance.
        \nBy understanding these activation functions and their trade-offs, you can 
        make informed choices to optimize your ANN for the task at hand."""
